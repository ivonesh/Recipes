Ingredient | Amount
-|-
Shrimp, Medium-to-large, raw + peeled | 1.25 lbs
Garlic | 3 unpeeled cloves or 1.5 teaspoons minced

1. Roast the unpeeled garlic in an ungreased skillet over medium heat until completely soft and blackened, about 15 minutes
2. Peel the garlic once cool enough to handle
3. In a blender, puree the peeled garlic, tomatoes, and chipotle chiles.
4. In a medium (10-inch) skillet, heat the oil over medium-high. Add the puree and stir until reduced to the consistency of tomato paste, 5 minutes.
5. Stir in the cream, pepper, and oregano.
6. Reduce heat to medium and let simmer for several minutes for the flavors to come together.
7. Taste and season with salt, usually 1/2 teaspoon.
8. Add the shrimp and stir until they are just cooked through (just losing their translucency at the center), about 3 minutes.
